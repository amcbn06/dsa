# Lowest Common Ancestor queries on trees
These are a few techniques i encountered when solving problems related to finding the lowest common ancestor (lca) of two nodes in a tree. \
The complexities are written in the notation < $O(f(n)),\ O(g(n))$ >, meaning that the data structure requires $O(f(n))$ construction time and $O(g(n))$ query time.
